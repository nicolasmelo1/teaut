# TEAUT

## The easiest way to start automating

Teaut is a simple and extendable automation tool. As easy as writing a Notion page it is to start creating your automations. Each automation is a document that will run top to bottom. With this you can create "live" documents as you can with tools like Jupyter Notebook or Elixir's Livebook.
